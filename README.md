# ToDoTime
This browser extension allows you to stay organized and plan your time efficiently. Simply add items to your ToDoList, accessible with a tap from your browser and mark them as done when you are done.

## Popup
Your ToDoList lives in a popup, which appears when you press an icon on your taskbar. Use the provided buttons to add new tasks and edit old ones, and these will all be saved when you close the popup. Enjoy marking all of your ToDoItems as done, and stay organized by keeping track of what you have left to do. You can even add times in a separate box, allowing you to plan out your time efficiently.

## Option (coming soon!)
The option of picking your schedule and letting the popup plan out your schedule to keep you on track will soon be available.
